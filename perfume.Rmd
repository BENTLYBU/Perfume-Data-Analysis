# Perfume Dataset Analysis (R)

This repository contains exploratory data analysis of the [Perfume Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ayushghawana/perfume-dataset) using **R**.

## 📌 Introduction
Perfume is a lifestyle and fashion product that combines **brand identity, pricing, consumer preferences, and sensory attributes**.  
This project aims to explore patterns within the perfume dataset to understand:
- Category & Type
- Brand distribution
- Longevity and sillage (lasting power & scent projection)

## 🛠️ Tools
- **RStudio / R Markdown**
- R packages: `readr`,`dplyr`,`tidyr`,`stringr`,`janitor`,`ggplot2`,`ggrepel`,`scales`,`plotly`,`tibble`

```{r}
# Define function to check is package is installed
install_if_missing <- function(pkg){
  if (!require(pkg, character.only = TRUE)) {
    install.packages(pkg, dependencies = TRUE, repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org/")
    library(pkg, character.only = TRUE)
  }
}

# Install and load library
pkgs <- c("readr","dplyr","tidyr","stringr","janitor","ggplot2","ggrepel","scales","plotly","tibble","vcd")
invisible(lapply(pkgs, install_if_missing))
```


## 📂 Project Structure
- `data/` → raw dataset and cleaned dataset
- `scripts/` → R scripts for data cleaning, analysis, visualization, modeling
- `notebooks/` → R Markdown for step-by-step analysis
- `outputs/` → figures, reports
- `docs/` → research notes, methodology

## ❓ Research Questions
1.Market share of men's and women's fragrances
2.Number of perfumes under each brands
3.Market share of each category and type
4.Gender preference of category and type
5.Will type/Category influence longevity 

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Perform data cleaning (handle missing values, duplicates, normalize categories)
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Build visualizations with `ggplot2`
- Explore clustering/ML models (e.g., k-means, regression)

*Conclusion*

Our analysis of target audiences and fragrance categories reveals both market-level distribution and gender-specific preferences.

Overall market distribution (Pie chart)

Unisex fragrances represent the largest share (37.4%), indicating a major shift toward inclusivity and flexibility in fragrance design.

Female fragrances account for 33.0%, showing sustained importance but no longer dominating the market.

Male fragrances make up 29.5%, the smallest segment, suggesting relative underrepresentation in product offerings.

Category differences in raw counts (Heatmap: Count, most divergent)

Certain floral categories (e.g., Floral Fruity, Floral Rose) show a heavy skew toward the female segment.

For males, representation in these categories is very low, confirming that floral profiles remain strongly gendered toward women.

This reflects the traditional cultural alignment between floral notes and femininity.

Category shares by audience (Heatmap: Share, top categories)

Male-oriented strength: Woody Spicy, Woody Aromatic, and Oriental Spicy categories are disproportionately male, highlighting men’s preference for deeper and spicier profiles.

Female-oriented strength: Floral Fruity, Oriental Floral, and Amber Floral are much more represented among women.

Unisex-oriented strength: Certain categories such as Woody Floral and Amber Woody show higher shares in unisex products, suggesting these categories act as “bridges” between male and female markets.

📊 Key Insights

The fragrance market is no longer dominated by gendered products — unisex fragrances now hold the largest share.

Category preferences remain gendered, however:

Floral-based scents → largely female.

Woody/Spicy/Oriental → largely male.

Some blends (Woody Floral, Amber Woody) → well-suited to unisex positioning.

Business implications:

Brands should continue to invest in unisex lines, particularly around woody/floral blends that already appeal across genders.

For men, reinforcing woody and spicy scents aligns with current consumer demand.

For women, floral and fruity combinations remain central, but opportunities exist to innovate with more balanced profiles.

Our analysis of the top 10 perfume brands highlights the competitive landscape in terms of product portfolio size:

Jean Paul Gaultier dominates

With 94 perfumes, Jean Paul Gaultier leads the market by a significant margin.

This represents the largest single brand share (19.2%) among the top 10, showing its strong focus on product variety and innovation.

Strong challengers in the mid-range

Paris Corner (77 perfumes, 15.7%) and Armaf (70 perfumes, 14.3%) follow closely, together holding nearly one-third of the market within the top 10 brands.

These brands have built large and diverse portfolios, indicating aggressive strategies in product expansion.

Other notable players

Al Haramain (43, 8.6%), Fragrance World (42, 8.6%), and Lattafa (36, 7.1%) form a competitive mid-tier.

Traditional luxury brands like Giorgio Armani (30, 6.1%), Hugo Boss (33, 6.7%), and Azzaro (35, 7.3%) maintain stable presence but with smaller portfolios relative to the leaders.

📊 Key Insights

Jean Paul Gaultier, Paris Corner, and Armaf collectively account for almost 50% of the top 10 market share, making them the clear leaders in terms of product variety.

Luxury houses (Armani, Hugo Boss, Azzaro) have comparatively smaller portfolios, but they may rely more on brand equity and premium positioning than sheer volume.

Emerging and Middle Eastern brands (Lattafa, Al Haramain, Fragrance World) are significant players, reflecting the globalization of perfume markets and the growing importance of niche/affordable luxury brands.

Q3: Market Share by Category and Type

Category insights (Top 20)

Woody Spicy (14.4%) and Florential (13.0%) are the clear leaders, together covering over one-quarter of the market.

Oriental Floral (8.7%) is also highly represented, reinforcing the dominance of complex floral–oriental blends.

Secondary but still notable categories include Woody Aromatic (4.5%), Amber Floral (4.5%), and Floral Fruity (3.8%).

The distribution shows that the market favors woody, spicy, and floral–oriental blends, while lighter categories such as Fresh Aquatic (1.2%) and Fresh Spicy (0.9%) remain niche.

Type insights

Eau de Parfum (EDP) overwhelmingly dominates with 76.9% of the market. This confirms that brands and consumers heavily prefer this concentration, balancing strength and wearability.

Eau de Toilette (EDT) follows at 14.6%, serving as the lighter alternative but still significant.

Other types such as Parfum (4.1%), Extrait de Parfum (1.9%), and Cologne (1.2%) represent much smaller shares, while formats like oil, concentrate, attar, alcohol-free remain marginal (<1%).

📊 Key Insights

The fragrance market is highly concentrated in a few dominant categories: Woody, Spicy, and Floral–Oriental blends define the majority of offerings.

EDP is the industry standard, dwarfing all other perfume types — showing that consumers value strong, long-lasting scents but not as extreme as pure Parfum or Extrait.

Business implications:

Brands competing in woody–spicy or floral–oriental spaces must differentiate strongly to stand out in a crowded field.

Opportunities exist in niche/light categories (e.g., fresh scents, aquatic types) for targeting younger or seasonal consumers.

While EDP remains king, differentiation in EDT or niche formats could appeal to consumers seeking variety beyond the mainstream.

Our analysis focused on the relationship between fragrance type/category and longevity.

Using chi-square tests and residual analysis, we found a statistically significant association between the two, with very clear directional patterns.

Long-Lasting Fragrances (Very Strong / Strong)

Extrait de Parfum (high-concentration perfumes) is heavily over-represented in the Very Strong longevity group. This aligns perfectly with product positioning: higher concentrations naturally lead to longer-lasting scents.

Woody, Oud, and Rose categories are also strongly over-represented in the Strong group, showing that these ingredients are typically linked with longer longevity.

Conclusion: High-concentration formats combined with deep woody/rose-based notes are the typical market choice for long-lasting perfumes.

Lighter Longevity (Light / Medium)

Eau de Toilette (EDT) is strongly over-represented in the Light group and severely under-represented in the Strong group.

Similarly, fresh and floral light categories tend to underperform in the Medium group, indicating a preference for shorter, lighter experiences.

Conclusion: Lighter concentrations and fresher scent profiles naturally lean toward shorter-lasting usage.

Under-Represented Segments

Many Floral and Oriental Floral fragrances are under-represented in the Medium group. This suggests a “polarized” pattern: they are either formulated as light, fleeting perfumes or pushed directly into strong, long-lasting territory.

Conclusion: Certain categories show a two-pole distribution, rarely occupying the middle ground.

📊 Key Insights

Type and category do influence longevity, and the findings are consistent with fragrance industry intuition:

Higher concentration + heavier notes → longer-lasting scents.

Lower concentration + fresher notes → lighter, shorter-lasting scents.

Business implications:

For markets demanding long-lasting performance, brands should prioritize Extrait de Parfum formats and emphasize Woody / Oud / Rose compositions.

For everyday, casual consumers, the focus should be on EDT / fresh scents.

This analysis bridges consumer expectations with product design decisions, helping brands position products more strategically.
